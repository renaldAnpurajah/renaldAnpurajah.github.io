					<p> The Economic Crisis in Sri Lanka has had its phases. Covid-19 was an accelerating factor of the
						economic crisis. When we take a look at people’s Google Search Trends, we can clearly see how
						citizens’ priorities have changed over time. I have presented this using an animated dashboard
						in the form of modern Data Storytelling.
					</p>
					<h3>Has Sri Lanka forgotten Covid-19 due to the Economic Crisis?
					</h3><br />
					Google search trends could say a lot about the masses' priorities. I have visualized how Sri
					Lankans' search patterns have changed since 2020 with regard to the following topics: Covid-19,
					Petrol, Fuel (in general), and Gas (LP gas is mostly known as 'gas' in SL).
					<br /> <br />
					Power cut-related searches have been trending ever since the scheduled power cut was introduced. The
					same goes for LP gas-related search since its shortage. Fuel-related searches have also been
					trending lately; however, they peaked in popularity when the National Fuel Pass was introduced.
					<br /> <br />
					However, while Covid-19 was constantly being searched since 2020, most stopped looking up
					information related to it as soon as the economic crisis led to shortages becoming apparent in early
					2022. Note that a considerable amount of new Covid-19 cases and deaths were reported until the mid
					of March 2022.
					<br /> <br />
					It is almost as if the whole country forgot about the pandemic. Well, now that these shortages seem
					to die down a little bit and the Covid-19 cases are on the rise again, it might pick up traction
					again.
					<br /> <br />
					You can see an embedded interactive Dashboard below. Alternatively, you could see a Linked post
					where I posted the animated dashboard in the form of a video by <a

					<P> <em>Note: Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the
							given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50
							means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for
							this term.
